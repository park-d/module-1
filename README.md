# Module-1 Challenge: Horiseon Webpage Refactoring

## Description

In order to learn more about efficient and accessible code, I refactored this webpage using semantic HTML elements, structured elements in a logical flow, added alt text to any images or icons included in the webpage, managed organization of heading attributes, and added a concise title. This challenge was taken on in order to make an existing webpage more accessible and improve long-term sustainability for the webpage.
